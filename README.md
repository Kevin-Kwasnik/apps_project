###Project Overview & Data
**The Business Problem**
<br>
You’re working for a marketing consultancy firm (congrats on the new job!) One of your
clients is a company that designs operating systems, and they want to build a major
apps store into their user interface. To this end, they want to know whether Google Play
apps have higher reviews on average than Apple Store apps (or vice versa), as they’re
intending to strike a deal with just one of these companies.
To complete this project, you’ll work through a series of steps known as the Data
Science Pipeline, or DSP. The DSP is a general and fairly broad sequence of steps data
scientists use to tackle and solve business problems. While working on this project,
you’ll complete each step of the DSP, including:
1. Sourcing and loading data
2. Cleaning and transforming data
3. Visualizing and modeling data
4. Evaluating, presenting findings, and concluding your work
